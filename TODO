i have finished the main rectangle extract from the Image.

big move!
the main process is ok!
next is the test the recall and the right of the system.
and the speed maybe can be improved!
the codes also can be writed more beautiful.

1)add RC method, but this method cost more time. maybe can 
resize the detected image to reduce the time costing.
2)add remove margin method.
    in the saliency map extract, sometimes the margin can
    become the saliency area, because it different from the
    rest of the image. so before the saliency extraction,
    remove the margin first.
    but the method now running is a little over, in some image
    it remove most content of the image.

question:
    1) reduce the RC method time costing [level normal]
    2) remove the margin more carefull [level high]
       maybe by making the upper of the margin less.
       reduce the most possible area of margin
